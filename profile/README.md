# OWLs Project

## Overview
OWLs (Open Web and Links) Project is designed to fetch, verify, and manage news articles. It includes a model that generate content from collected news from various internet sources (e.g., Twitter, news websites, and APIs), other models to verify the authenticity of these articles, and various tools like Scrapping, APIs fetching to stores them in a structured database(Postgres) and Unstructred database like(MongoDB).   Subsequently, the project generates creative and contextually relevant social media memes and posts based on these verified articles, making it an innovative solution for the modern ```advertising``` and ```social media``` landscape.  
Offcourse there could be many ways we can implement these but for now this is our base model, and we will expand as soon as possible.

The OWLs Project is divided into three distinct phases:

1. **Phase 1: News Fetching and Data Collection**  
   - **Automatic News Search:** Automatically scrapes articles from sources like Twitter, Reddit and APIs using web scraping and API integration techniques.
   - **Authenticity Verification:** Implements algorithms to detect fake news using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
   - **Database Storage:** Stores verified articles in a database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB, ensuring proper indexing for efficient retrieval.

2. **Phase 2: Content Generation**  
   - **Meme and Post Generation:** AI models create memes and posts by analyzing the tone and content of the news.
   - **Theme-Based Image Creation:** Dynamically generates symbolic images to represent news without explicitly depicting real individuals.

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features**  
   - **AI Model Integration:** Enhances creativity using cutting-edge models for improved meme and post generation.
   - **Deployment:** Scales the application using Cloud like AWS, or Azure with Docker and Kubernetes to ensure reliability in production.

## Features
- **Automated News Collection:** Real-time fetching of news from various platforms using a combination of web scraping and API integration.
- **Authenticity Verification:** Ensures only genuine articles are stored by leveraging various methods and techniques including machine learning models trained on extensive datasets.
- **Content Generation:** Produces engaging memes and social media posts using advanced text and image generation techniques, stable diffusion models for now.
- **Theme-Based Imagery:** Generates images relevant to the news content without direct representation of individuals to avoid copyright or privacy issues.
